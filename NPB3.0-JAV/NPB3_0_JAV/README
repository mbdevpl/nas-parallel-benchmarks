The NPB3_0_JAV contains serial and multithreaded versions of the 
NPB3.0-SER derived from the NPB2.3-serial version of the NAS Parallel 
Benchmarks (except EP).

The implementaion was obtaind by a semiautomatic direct translation of
FORTRAN to Java. The code is written in pure Java. 

The threaded implementation is similar to OpenMP version. It uses the
master-worker work distribution model. We use wait()/notify() pair to
move a thread to/from blocked state. In order to move a specific thread
from blocked state we call its notify method.
