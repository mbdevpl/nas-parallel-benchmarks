Changes in non-MPI versions of NPB (previously PBN3.0)
      (NPB3.0-SER, NPB3.0-HPF, NPB3.0-OMP, NPB3.0-JAV)
------------------------------------------------------

[01-Mar-99] Initial Beta Release.

[06-Apr-99] Based on report from Charles Grassl and Ramesh Menon (SGI).

   1. NPB-SER, FT: file auxfnct.f -
      lines 74 and 75 were interchanged:

      double complex u0(d1+1,d2,d3), tmp(maxdim)
      integer d1,d2,d3

   2. NPB-OMP: The OpenMP standards requires reduction variable be scalars,
      thus, changes made to remove the use of array variable for reduction.
      Relevant modifications in EP, CG, LU, SP, and BT

   3. NPB-OMP: Remove compiler warnings of "Referenced scalar variables 
      use defaults" by declaring explicitly as shared.
      Relevant modifications in FT, LU, and BT

   4. NPB-OMP, README.openmp: Explicitly spell out the requirement of
      the static scheduling (setenv OMP_SCHEDULE "static").


[05-Oct-99] NPB3.0-non-MPI Beta Release (02)

General change to all (NPB-SER, NPB-HPF, NPB-OMP) -
   1. Update header information for all benchmarks.

   2. Allow continuation lines in 'make.def' (modification done
      in sys/setparams.c).

Change made in NPB-OMP -
   1. 'print_results' now prints Number-Of-Threads and Mflops/s/thread.
      The printed number is the activated threads during the run, which
      may not be the same as what's requested.

   2. A initial data touch loop for array A is added in CG.

   3. 'CRITICAL' section is used for reduction with array.
      Relevant changes in EP, CG, LU, SP, and BT.

   4. Reconfigure 'make.def' such that 'omp_lib_dum' can be activated
      from the file for no directive compilation.

   5. The "!$OMP END DO" seems needed before "!$OMP MASTER" in rhs.f
      for both BT and SP for some f90 compilers.

   6. "SCHEDULE(STATIC)" are used for the pipeline in LU to ensure
      compliance with the OMP standard.

Change made in NPB-HPF -
   1. 'print_results' now prints Number-Of-Processes and Mflops/s/process.

   2. Use more consistent output format (via print_results).

   3. More consistent makefiles (via config/make.def).


[04-Apr-00] NPB3.0-non-MPI Beta Release (03)

Change made in NPB-OMP -
   1. The OpenMP-C version of IS has been added, including more timers.

   2. 'cprint_results' includes Number-Of-Threads and Mflops/s/thread.

Change made in NPB-SER -
   1. More timers included in IS.

NPB-JAV has been included in NPB3.0-non-MPI.


[31-May-01] NPB3.0-non-MPI Beta Release (04)

Change made in NPB-OMP -
   1. NPB-OMP/LU: Failure in verification for number of threads greater 
      than the problem size is now fixed.

   2. If OMP_NUM_THREADS is unset, the printout will report as "unset"
      instead of "1"

   3. NPB-OMP/IS: Allocating work_buff on the stack seems to cause problem
      for large problem size (CLASS C).  "work_buff" is now allocated
      by "malloc" on the heap for CLASS C.

   4. NPB-OMP/IS: Reported by <RaeLyn.Crowell@compaq.com> - potential
      synchronization problem could arise due to the use of "static"
      variables inside "randlc()".  Declaration of these static variables
      are moved out of randlc() and put in the threadprivate directive.

General change to all (NPB-SER, NPB-HPF, NPB-OMP) -
   1. Cleanup in makefiles


[28-Aug-02] The Official NPB3.0 Release

Change made in all -
   1. Fixed a bogus verification for "NaN".

   2. Name change from "PBN3.0" to "NPB3.0". Updated all the banners.

   3. NPB-SER/FT: use a derived version from NPB2.3-serial.

   4. NPB-HPF/FT: use a consistent printing format.
